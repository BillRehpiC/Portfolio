<h1> About the Game:</h1>
<p>This game was created for a game jam ! 

This game was made for fun, and definitely shouldn't be taken seriously, it is filled with multiple jokes and features, and any similarities with people that exist are coincidences apart from two characters that are pictures of real people :D 

Good work! You finally managed to buy a new house! However, this one seems to be haunted by a ghost and, it seems like he takes particular enjoyment in pranking you! 

Interact with the anomalies he spreads around the house to send them away, otherwise you might just go insane! </p>

<h1> Main mechanics made by me:</h1>
<p> One of the main things I programmed in this game was the UI,Main menu and pause menu.
I really liked working on this project because i got to work with a different set of mechanics with the anomalies going on.
I worked on the anomalies in the bedroom, my favorite being the pc pop up, the knocking on the door and the spinning frog. 
It was the first time i had worked with this many people before and it was fun. We managed to communicate pretty well between us, scheduling sleep times and mechanics pretty well.
I really liked how this turned out to be, a goffy but fun game to make.</p>
