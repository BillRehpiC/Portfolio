<h1> About the Game:</h1>
<p>In this game, you are a goblin who just started his business. Your objective is to sell items. But be careful, or you might go bankrupt!

This game was made in the GameJam "StayLab Gamejam" where the theme was market.</p>
<br>     </br>
<h1> Main mechanics made by me:</h1>
<p> One of the main things I programmed in this game was the UI,from the little coin to the hand animaion in 2D, to even being the one to program the coin system from adding or subtracting money</p>

<p> Another mechanic I worked on was, client spawning. I made t so it checks if there's a client, if its not, it creates one, startes a counter of time to be served if its not served within that time, the client destroys itself but before it tells the spawner that its about o destroy itself in order to spawn another client.</p>

<p> Another thing I worked on in this project, was the scene management, from the main menu to the pause menu and of course, winning and loosing screens.</p>
