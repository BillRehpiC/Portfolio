<h1> About this game</h1>
<p>“A mutant hero battles virus-altered foes in alternate history sidescroller”

Plaguebound is a sidescroller and 2D platformer game set in an alternate timeline where a biology alternating virus attacked the world again. We follow our main protagonist, a mutated human that, mysteriously, managed to gain the mutation's powers while also maintaining his human cognitive functions, making him a powerful being that could take the fight to the entities that emerged from the mutations. </p>
<h1>Mechanics envolved</h1>
<p> this game was fully programed by me. It was my first ever Game. It features enemy figthing. checkpoint saving (which are enligthen by having a ligth on them using the ligth features on unity ) And achievement system </p>

<br>     </br>
<p>this work was challanging because of my lack of expertise and wanting to work wwith ligth systems</p>

<p>In the previous image you can see the "enemy" glowing because it's sitting in front of the said checkpoint</p>

<p>Another mechanic used was the health factor, each time you'd get hit, you're life would go down. when it reached 0, it would play a death animation and the loose screen</p>
<p>A big challange was my artist, communication wasn't great and he did the background as one singular painting, which made it so i had to create a bunch of empty objets to work around that mistake.Another challange was working with achievement. The way I did it was that i had a manager that would not be destroyed apon changing the level in order to keep track what the player has done, Has it lost some health? has it killed any enemiy? etc.</p>
