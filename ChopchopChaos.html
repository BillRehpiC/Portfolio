<h1> About this game</h1>
<p>Unfortunatly, this game ended up being deleted as our game designer gave up and our artist was unable to fully finish his side of the project. In terms of programming perspective. It worked very well with almost no bugs. This game was done in a school project for my second year where we had to do a 3D game. We decided to do a game where u need to cook under pressure</p>
<h1>Mechanics envolved</h1>
<p>this game was a bit of a challange since it envolved mechanic like chopping meat which envolved messing with physics I had never done. It's one of my favorite projects despite the sad ending precisely because it was challanging. There was also money mechanic which I had already worked with in Goblin's business so it wasn't new. But, another challanging part was, changing mesh according to different aspects, such as: -character satisfation face and cooking state.</p>
<br>     </br>
<p>This work was also one of the few works where I used Niagara effects for smoke, and cooking in order to achieve a more realistic result and emersive one. lastly, a timer, the game challanging aspect was that u had x amount of time to do and get x money or u would loose. Again, this part wasn't particularly hard since I had worked with money managing in a previous game</p>
